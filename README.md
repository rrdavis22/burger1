# Installation
NPM install should be run, NPM start should be run after. A local MySQL connection is required for this app. I used MAMP for development.

# Usage
This app can be used to keep track of orders, and was developed for learning how to use express, sequelize heroku, and node.

# Credits
Triology Education Services assigned this homework to practice on using express, sequelize heroku, and node. Credit to Jake O’Toole for the format of this readme.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge for me on this app was making API calls with Axios. I was missing some lines of code in the server file which wasn’t parsing my responses into JSON leading to some weird responses.
